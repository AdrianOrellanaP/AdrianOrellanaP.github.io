      <h3>Dan Harmon has written many times about audiovisual storytelling. The most important that is reflected in Rick and Morty is the difference between the basic narrative of feature film format and the basic narrative that is supported by television (alluding above all to the sitcom genre).

        All the episodes of Rick and Morty follow the basic structure developed by Harmon and which he calls "Embryo of a story". It is a circular scheme divided into 8 steps:</h3>
  <h3>
    1. A character is in his comfort zone.<br>
2. But he wants something.<br>
3. He enters an unrecognized situation.<br>
4. He adapts to it.<br>
5. Get what he wants.<br>
6. But he pays a high price.<br>
7. Return to the starting situation, comfortable.<br>
8. He Has changed.
